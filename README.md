# Heart Disease Prediction and Analysis
- This Python project focuses on the exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualization of heart disease data, aiming to provide insights into cardiovascular diseases.
- The project utilizes libraries like pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and seaborn for data processing and visualization.

## Features
1. Perform comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) on heart disease data.
2. Visualize relationships between various features using different types of plots (KDE, displot, pairplot).
3. Analyze univariate and bivariate distributions to understand the impact of features on heart disease.
4. Detect and visualize outliers in the dataset.
